JavaScript Definitions

1. Variables are memory placeholders for objects. Using the 'var' keyword to
indicate that we want to store some information we then give the variable a name.
Then using the '=' assignment operator, we assign the value to be stored. Values
can be strings enclosed in single or double quotations marks, numbers, null,
functions, or Boolean true or false.

2. Strings are literal typed object such as words. Strings are always surrounded
by quotation marks, single or double.

3. Functions are blocks of code that can be run, or called many times. The code
blocks include the instructions for JavaScript to perform. Variable assigned inside
the function are available only within the function.

 4. If Statements are code blocks used to check for truth or falseness, comparing
 2 or more things and then running a code block if the condition is true. If the
 conditions are false, the code block is skipped and not run.

5. Boolean Values are binary in nature and can be represented as true or false,
0 or 1, on or off, + voltage or 0 voltage, or + or - voltage. Boolean values
are returned after checking the conditions of an If Statement.
